- üîó **Flexible Sharing**: Public and private file sharing with expiration dates
- üìÅ **Folder Management**: Hierarchical organization with drag-and-drop interface
- üõ°Ô∏è **Virus Scanning**: Integrated ClamAV for malware detection
- üë• **User Management**: Role-based authentication and admin controls
- üíæ **Storage Quotas**: Per-user disk quotas and usage tracking
- üåì **Modern UI**: Dark/light theme support with Material-UI
- üìä **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive management tools and analytics
- üîê **Security Features**: Rate limiting, CORS, security headers, and more
- üöÄ **Docker Ready**: Production-ready containerized deployment

## Quick Start

1. **Download configuration:**
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/relayum/relayum/main/.env.example
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/relayum/relayum/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings (see Security section below)
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   
   **With virus scanning (recommended):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose --profile clamav up -d
   ```
   
   **Without virus scanning:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   
   > **Note:** ClamAV initialization can take 5-10 minutes for virus definition downloads. The app will start before ClamAV is ready.

4. **Access:** Open `http://localhost:3020`

## Security Configuration

**IMPORTANT:** Change these required settings in your `.env` file:

```env
# Database password
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# JWT secrets (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
JWT_SECRET=your_32_character_jwt_secret_here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_32_character_refresh_secret_here

# Metadata encryption key (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
METADATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_metadata_key_here

# Admin account
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password

# Domain (for production)
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Requirements

- **Docker**: 20.10+ with Docker Compose 2.0+
